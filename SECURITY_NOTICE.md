# 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE

## ⚠️ Your API Key Has Been Exposed!

Your OpenAI API key was previously hardcoded in the application code and **is now visible in multiple places** (code files, chat history, potentially version control).

### 🔴 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

1. **Revoke the compromised API key NOW**:
   - Visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Find this key: `sk-proj-Wbv-ugaDDiQWw8ZR4NAL-ZYqnGP4-...`
   - Click **"Revoke"** to disable it immediately

2. **Generate a new API key**:
   - Click **"Create new secret key"**
   - Name it: "JJ Analytics Dashboard"
   - **Copy it and save it securely**
   - **Never share it or commit it to code**

3. **Use the new key properly**:
   - For **local development**: Add to `.streamlit/secrets.toml` (not committed to Git)
   - For **cloud deployment**: Add to Streamlit Cloud Secrets (secure)
   - See `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for full instructions

## 🔐 Why This Matters

An exposed API key allows anyone to:
- ❌ Use your OpenAI account
- ❌ Rack up charges on your bill
- ❌ Access or misuse AI capabilities
- ❌ Potentially violate OpenAI's terms of service

---

## ✅ What We Fixed

The code has been updated to:
- ✅ Read API keys from **Streamlit secrets** (for cloud deployment)
- ✅ Fall back to **environment variables** (for local development)
- ✅ **Never** hardcode sensitive credentials
- ✅ Include `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of secrets

---

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Revoke old key** (most important!)
2. **Read `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** for full deployment instructions
3. **Set up secrets properly** for local and cloud environments
4. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud** (free hosting!)

## 🛡️ Future Best Practices

### Always:
- ✅ Use environment variables or secrets management
- ✅ Add secrets files to `.gitignore`
- ✅ Regularly rotate API keys
- ✅ Monitor usage for anomalies
- ✅ Set spending limits on OpenAI account

### Never:
- ❌ Hardcode API keys in code
- ❌ Commit secrets to version control
- ❌ Share keys via email, chat, or screenshots
- ❌ Use the same key across multiple projects
